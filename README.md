# Read Some Greek - The Greek Texts

## Daniel (LXX)

The text of Daniel is taken from Henry Barclay Swete's 1896 edition of the Septuagint. It is in the public domain.

## Pseudo-Apollodorus

The text of Pseudo-Apollodorus' *Library* is taken from Sir James George Frazer's 1921 edition, so is in the public domain.

## Copyright

The texts are in the public domain. I do not believe that any work related to digitization creates any new rights to the texts but if they do, I waive them.

## Acknowledgements

Those familiar with [MorphGNT](http://morphgnt.org/) will immediately notice the its influence on the text formatting. I have gone my own way in some significant ways in regard to punctuation and versification but much of the general format and the codes themselves are all shamelessly lifted from this very awesome project. My departures are subject to change.

And in the spirit of shamelessly lifting from another open source project (with attribution, of course), here is some information on my format.
